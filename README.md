Personal Project to track progress and utilze multiple computers to develop a workable game engine. 

Intended tasks to complete: 

  1. Basic UI interface with interactable components, including inputs and outputs
  2. GUI utilizing built in libraries from Java, shown in minesweeper game
     - Updates both on click and on a timer
     - Has interactable components drawn onto screen
     - Includes some game logic
  3. CPU Rendering
     - Move graphics away from built in library to modifying pixels and graphics buffer
     - Handles errors regarding graphics
     - Creates objectives that grant points
     - Objects in game interact with eachother
     - Achievement system and high scores are saved
     - Some degree of customization to basic elements of visual components, settings
  4. GPU Rendering
     - Utilize OpenGL to create 3D environment to render game objects
     - More tasks TBD
